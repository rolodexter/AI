# Books Policy — Map-Only

**Scope.** This portal is a high-level map. Full manuscripts live in their own repos.
**Canonical Link.** Every book page must include:
- `canonical_repo` : URL of the dedicated repo
- `canonical_release` : pinned release tag (e.g., v0.4-draft1) when available

**No Duplication.** Do not mirror full chapters here. Optional short excerpt ≤ 1,000 words for context.
**Peer Review.** Track review state via frontmatter `status: working|preprint|in-review|peer-reviewed`  and link to the discussion board in the canonical repo.
**Citation & License.** Manuscript repo must provide `CITATION.cff`  and license. This portal shows citation snippet and links only.
**Audience & Routing.** Use `audience` , `hub` , `lanes` , and `tags`  to surface books on relevant hub pages.

> Ethos: map → navigate → jump out to the canonical source. No stale copies.
